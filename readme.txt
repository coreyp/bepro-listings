== Description ==
[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfASHxSNIHY /]

Bepro Listings allows you to create posts with a combination of additional information like, costs, contact, or geography. Widgets and shortcodes then help you to search and view this information via various formats including google maps. Consider using these building blocks for your next listing site. 

This plugin is for those looking to implement listing type features into their own custom design. Setup categories and control various aspects including, number of images, default search distance, and page details. With the new buddypress option, you can allow your members to control their own submissions (add/edit/delete).

= KEY FEATURES =
* Buddypress - (New for 1.2.0) Allow your users to manage their submissions from their profile
* Custom posts - This way the listings are seperate to your other posts in the admin and front end
* Google Maps api v3.5 - latest with no need for API keys
* Wordpress Integration - Admin is familiar and integrates with your design
* Shortcodes & Widgets - Several ways to feature the information and engage your visitor.
* Admin Options - Control which features and information are available

= NOTE =

CSS skills are recommended to make the various functionality integrate well with your current theme. The css bundled with the plugin is purely to demonstrate capabilities and is based on the default theme.

= SHORTCODES =

* Dynamic Map - Setup a map anywhere showing the last listings on your site e.g. [generate_map show_paging=1]
* Basic Search - Allow users to search listings e.g. [search_form]
* Filter Search - Allow users to do a more in depth search including, cost, date, etc e.g. [filter_form]
* Listings - Show listings with optional paging e.g. [display_listings show_paging=1]
* Add Listing Form - Give your users the ability to create listings. You can set a default user id for the listing or force registration. e.g. [create_listing_form register=1]

= TROUBLE SHOOTING =

* 404 Error - Unfortunately, wordpress has an existing issue with custom post types. If Listing pages produce a 404 error, try resetting your permalink settings in the admin. Simply re-save your current settings so that they are reset for all urls. The option is under your settings menu.
