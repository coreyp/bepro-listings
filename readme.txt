This plugin includes the tools needed to implement searchable listings on any page or post.

== Description ==

Bepro Listings allows you to create posts with a combination of additional information like, costs, contact, or geography.  This will help you to make your listing site unique. This plugin is for those looking to implement listing type features into their own custom design. Alternative WordPress listing plugins, force you to use their layout and organization. This plugin utilizes the wordpress api so its fully integrated where possible. This means the admin is familiar and the functionality is easily utilized via shortcodes and widgets.

Note

CSS skills are recommended to make the various functionality integrate well with your current theme. The css bundled with the plugin is purely to demonstrate capabilities. We distribute themes with the advanced version of this plugin, if you need a complete solution.


Shortcodes

* Dynamic Map - Setup a map anywhere showing the last X listings on your site e.g. [generate_map num_results=10 show_paging=1]
* Basic Search - Allow users to search listings e.g. [search_form]
* Filter Search - Allow users to do a more in depth search including, cost, date, etc e.g. [filter_form]
* Listings - Show X listings with optional paging e.g. [display_listings num_results=10 show_paging=1]
* Add Listing Form - Give your users the ability to create listings. You can set a default user id for the listing or force registration. e.g. [create_listing_form num_images=3 register=1]

Trouble Shooting

* 404 Error - Unfortunately, wordpress has an existing issue with custom post types. If Listing pages produce a 404 error, try resetting your permalink settings in the admin. Simply re-save your current settings so that they are reset for all urls. The option is under your settings menu.
