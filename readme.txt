This plugin includes the tools needed to implement searchable listings on any page or post.

== Description ==

Bepro Listings allows you to create posts with additional information like, costs, contact, and geography.  This will help you to make your listing site unique. This plugin is for those looking to implement listing type features into their own custom design. Alternative WordPress listing plugins, force you to use their layout and organization. This plugin utilizes the wordpress api so its fully integrated where possible. This means the admin is familiar and the functionality is easily utilized via shortcodes and widgets.


Shortcodes

* Dynamic Map - Setup a map anywhere showing the last X listings on your site e.g. [generate_map num_results=10 show_paging=1]
* Basic Search - Allow users to search listings e.g. [search_form geo=1]
* Filter Search - Allow users to do a more in depth search including, cost, date, etc e.g. [filter_form  geo=1]
* Listings - Show X listings with optional paging e.g. [display_listings num_results=10 show_paging=1]
* Add Listing Form - Give your users the ability to create listings. You can set a default user id for the listing or force registration. e.g. [create_listing_form num_images=3 register=1 geo=1 ]

Trouble Shooting

* Google Api Calls - If your form submissions seem to be taking long, this may be as a result of your server waiting for a response from google. All Lat/Lon queries are sent there. For this reason, we suggest you use the options where available in the plugin, to not retrieve the Lat/Lon when not necessary.

* 404 Error - Unfortunately, wordpress has an existing issue with custom post types. If Listing pages produce a 404 error, try resetting your permalink settings in the admin. Simply re-save them your current settings so that they are reset for all urls. The option is under your settings menu.
